# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 3, 2016 

**Today's Progress**: 
Worked on HTML5 only tribute page (Interaction and style and responsiveness will be added later) 

**Thoughts:** I just completed [HTML5 MASTERY](http://index-of.es/Programming/HTML5.Mastery.pdf) book and I am practicing what I have learned. The goal is to create a page that works even with CSS & JS off, which is ideal in a country like Liberia. This project may span multiple days.
