# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 3, 2016  Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: 
Worked on HTML5 only tribute page (Interaction and style and responsiveness will be added later) 

**Thoughts:** I just completed [HTML5 MASTERY](http://index-of.es/Programming/HTML5.Mastery.pdf) book and I am practicing what I have learned. The goal is to create a page that works even with CSS & JS off, which is ideal in a country like Liberia. This project may span multiple days.

### Day 1: January 4, 2016  Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: 
Today I practiced a little CSS. I am very comfortable with CSS but just wanted to sharpen my skills before styling my Tribute page and starting my Portfolio project.

**Thoughts:** As part of the challange, I tried creating a simple CSS only switch. I idea was very simple just took longer than I expected. I finally got it to work though. The code for this will be used in the portfolio project. Look at the code in the practice.html file.
